# timetable_cli

This app will display departures from a given train/bus station via the transport.rest API. It is entirely CLI based and will
have a UI which can be navigated via the keyboard. For now, it can only fetch and display all departures from the station specified in
the config.json file for a given time period and be quit using the "Q" key.
